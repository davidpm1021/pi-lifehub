- ‚úÖ Local SQLite storage
- üîÑ Auto-start on boot (scripts ready, needs Pi deployment)
- ‚úÖ Health check and monitoring scripts
- ‚úÖ Complete automation via setup script

### Phase 2 Features Status
- ‚úÖ **Voice Commands Framework**: Complete API and service architecture
  - Endpoints: `/api/voice/status`, `/api/voice/listen`, `/api/voice/start`, `/api/voice/stop`
  - Wake word support ("hey hub")
  - Command processing system
  - ‚ùå **Blocked**: Needs PyAudio and SpeechRecognition dependencies
- ‚ùå **Weather Module**: Only stub files
- ‚ùå **Photos Module**: Only stub files  
- ‚ùå **Timer Module**: Only stub files

### Technical Achievements
- FastAPI backend with async endpoints
- SQLite database with user/todo tables
- Touch-friendly CSS with proper scaling
- Responsive grid layout for 7" screen
- Error handling and offline functionality
- Systemd service for auto-start (ready)
- X11 touchscreen configuration (ready)
- Performance optimizations for Pi 5
- Complete voice command infrastructure

### Current Status: MVP DEPLOYED, NEEDS SERVICE SETUP üîÑ

### Blockers for Full Deployment
- Auto-startup service not configured (need to run setup script on Pi)
- Voice module needs PyAudio/SpeechRecognition dependencies
- Database has 81 duplicate test users (cleanup needed)
- Phase 2 modules (weather/photos/timer) are empty stubs

- [ ] Clean up duplicate database users
- [ ] Implement weather widget with API integration
- [ ] Build photo slideshow functionality
- [ ] Add timer/stopwatch features
- [ ] Test voice commands with USB microphone

### Phase 2 Features to Complete
- [x] Voice commands ("Hey Hub") - Framework ready, needs deps
- [ ] Weather widget with local data
- [ ] Family photo slideshow
- [ ] Timer functionality with presets
- [ ] NFC reader integration
- [ ] Basic calendar view

### Preparation Tasks
- [x] Test MVP on actual Pi touchscreen (running)
- [ ] Gather family feedback on UI
- [ ] Order additional NFC tags if needed
- [ ] Research weather API options
- [ ] Plan photo storage structure

---

## Future Sprints

### Phase 3 (Week 3): External Integrations

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- FastAPI was perfect for rapid prototyping
- Touch-first CSS design approach
- Automated setup script saves time
- SQLite ideal for local storage
- Modular architecture with voice framework
- Comprehensive API design

### What Could Be Improved
- Add more visual feedback for touch
- Consider offline-first design patterns
- Plan for backup/restore functionality
- Add basic error logging
- Consider responsive breakpoints
- Clean up database duplicates earlier

### Key Decisions
- Used vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Local-first architecture with SQLite
- Kiosk mode for dedicated device
- 48px minimum touch targets
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Modular system for Phase 2 features

## Resource Usage

### Development Time
- Planning & docs: 30 min
- Backend development: 45 min
- Frontend development: 60 min
- Voice framework: 90 min
- Setup scripts: 30 min
- Documentation: 45 min
- **Total: ~5 hours**

### Next Session Priorities
