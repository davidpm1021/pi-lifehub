## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- FastAPI was perfect for rapid prototyping
- Touch-first CSS design approach
- Automated setup script saves time
- SQLite ideal for local storage
- Systemd integration seamless

### What Could Be Improved
- Add more visual feedback for touch
- Consider offline-first design patterns
- Plan for backup/restore functionality
- Add basic error logging
- Consider responsive breakpoints

### Key Decisions
- Used vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Local-first architecture with SQLite
- Kiosk mode for dedicated device
- 48px minimum touch targets
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds

## Resource Usage

### Development Time
- Planning & docs: 30 min
- Backend development: 45 min
- Frontend development: 60 min
- Setup scripts: 30 min
- Documentation: 45 min
- **Total: ~3.5 hours**

### Next Session Priorities
1. Deploy and test on actual Pi hardware
2. Gather family feedback on interface
3. Begin Phase 2 feature planning
4. Set up development workflow for iterations
